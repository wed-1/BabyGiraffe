Main challenge:

Was how can we create a game that helps children learn colors in a fun way.

##Solution Concept :

So we came up with a solution for a small children's game that combines play and learning together in a simple way to help motivate them to learn new colors so that can enhance their developing.

## Challenge Summary:

In the beginning, when we started creating the mini-educational game for children, we tried to benefit the largest number of children, so we added accessibility, we had difficulty with Any feature that is appropriate for the application, so we decided to reduce motion, applied it, and added localization in to benefit many children.
